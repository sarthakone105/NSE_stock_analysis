Title: Indian Stock Market Tobacco Stock Analysis and Visualization


**Project Overview:**
As a smoker with a keen interest in the financial world, I decided to delve into the Indian stock market to analyze and visualize the performance of the top three tobacco companies listed on the stock exchange. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource where you can find the data, code, and visualizations related to this analysis.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Collection:** I've gathered historical stock market data for the top three tobacco companies in India. This data forms the foundation of our analysis.

- **Data Analysis:** Utilizing Python and data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, I've conducted an in-depth analysis of the stock prices, trends, and financial indicators of these companies.

- **Data Visualization:** To make the analysis more accessible and insightful, I've created a variety of data visualizations, including interactive charts and graphs, that highlight key patterns and trends in the tobacco industry.

- **Smoker's Perspective:** Being a smoker myself, I've added a unique touch to the analysis by considering how changes in stock performance might impact the tobacco industry and, consequently, the smoker's experience.
